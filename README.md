# Makemore: Building a Character-Level Language Model with PyTorch

This project implements a character-level language model inspired by the principles of WaveNet and uses PyTorch to build and train various neural network models. The project is divided into multiple parts, each focusing on different aspects of model architecture and training.

## Introduction

The "makemore" series is an exploration of building a character-level generative model that can generate names based on a dataset of names. This project starts with a simple bigram model and gradually builds up to a WaveNet-inspired architecture, incorporating various neural network layers, optimization techniques, and training methodologies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of names stored in the `names.txt` file, which can be downloaded from the GitHub repository. The dataset is processed to create sequences of characters, which are used as input to the model.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/makemore/master/names.txt
```

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, with a context length of 8 characters used for the input sequences.

## Model Architecture

### Part 1: Bigram Model

The initial part of the project involves building a simple bigram model that predicts the next character based on the previous one. This is a basic model that serves as a foundation for more complex models later in the series.

### Part 2: MLP with One-Hot Encoding

The second part introduces a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, where input characters are one-hot encoded, and the model is trained to predict the next character. This part also introduces the concepts of embedding and using a context window for prediction.

### Part 3: Building Neural Network Layers

This part focuses on creating custom neural network layers in PyTorch, including:

- **Linear**: A fully connected layer with optional bias.
- **BatchNorm1d**: Batch normalization layer for stabilizing training.
- **Tanh**: Activation function for introducing non-linearity.
- **Embedding**: Embedding layer for converting characters to dense vectors.
- **FlattenConsecutive**: A custom layer for flattening input sequences.

### Part 4: Hierarchical Model

In this part, the model architecture is extended to a hierarchical structure, allowing for more efficient training and better performance. The context length is increased, and the model is trained on more complex sequences.

### Part 5: WaveNet-Inspired Model

The final part of the series implements a WaveNet-inspired model. The model uses dilated convolutions to process the input sequence more effectively, capturing long-range dependencies and improving the quality of generated names.

## Training

The models are trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a step learning rate schedule. The training process involves multiple iterations, and the performance of the models is monitored using cross-entropy loss.

```python
max_steps = 200000
batch_size = 32
```

The training loss is logged and plotted to observe the convergence of the model.

## Sampling

Once trained, the models can generate new names by sampling from the learned probability distribution. The sampling process involves initializing a context and iteratively predicting the next character until a termination character is reached.

```python
for _ in range(20):
    # Sampling code
```

The generated names are decoded and printed to evaluate the model's performance.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated on the training, validation, and test sets using cross-entropy loss. This helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

```python
@torch.no_grad()
def split_loss(split):
    # Evaluation code
```

## Conclusion

Throughout the "makemore" series, various neural network architectures are explored, starting from a simple bigram model to a complex WaveNet-inspired model. Each part builds on the previous one, introducing new concepts and techniques to improve the model's performance.

## Next Steps

The project hints at the possibility of using convolutions to improve the model further. Future work could involve implementing more sophisticated architectures and experimenting with different datasets.
